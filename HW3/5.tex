1. Let's first prove the smoothness-like inequality. $b_i'$ is essentially sampling highest among other players bid and bidding it. Thus probability of winning is $1/2$ (probability of random variable being bigger than identical random variable is 1/2). The payment under strategy $b_i'$ can be upper bounded by making the agent pay every time he bids, which results in $p(b_i')\leq \mathbb E_{p\in \cal P}(p)$. The smoothness-like inequality now follows.
