Assume that each player bids $b(v)$ which is a monotonously increasing function. If a player has valuation $v$ and bids $x$ the expected value is the probability of the player being among the top two bidders times the utility if that's the case. If all players bids according to $b(v)$ which is monotonously increasing that probability is equal to $x$ not being the lowest value, which is $1-(1-x)^2 = 2x-x^2$. Thus the expected value is

$$
(v-b(x))(2x-x^2)
$$

We can take derivates of this w.r.t $x$, setting to zero, taking $x=v$ and then integrating and trivially setting the integration constant to zero to obtain

$$
b'(v)(2v-v^2) = (v-b(v))(2-2v)
$$

$$
(b(v)(2v-v^2))' = v
$$

$$
b(v) = \frac{v^2}{2(2v-v^2)}
$$

By taking derivates we can trivially confirm that the function is indeed monotonously increasing.
