\subsection{a}

Suppose the click-rates for setting the prices are $0$ and $1$ but that the real rates are $1$ and $1+\epsilon$, and that we have players who values clicks as $1$ and $1.5$. If both players report their real valuations the player with the higher valuation will pay $1$ per click, which gives him a utility of $0.5(1+\epsilon)$. If he changes strategy to report $1-\epsilon$ he will pay $0$, get $1$ click and have a utility of $1.5$.

We gave an example where bidding one's value wasn't dominating, in the same example bidding over ones value will not be dominating.

-todo, underbidding


\subsection{b}

From the formula given we see that the utility a player receives is bounded by 

$$
(1+\epsilon) \bigg(\alpha_i u_i - \sum_{j>i}b_j (\alpha_{j-1} - \alpha_j) \bigg)
$$
