\textbf{a)}Suppose that we have a Nash equilibra where some player $i$ gets less then $N/2k$. Clearly the player $j$ with the most utility gets at least $N/k$. Now suppose that $i$ moves to the same place as $j$, if there is only $j$ there then $i$ gets at least half of the utility of $j$, which is at least $N/2k$ - if there are more then one player at that location before $i$ moves there he/she will get even more then $N/2k$. The fact that $i$ can get more then his/her utility by moving contradicts the fact that we are in a equilibra, and we have a proof by contradiction.
