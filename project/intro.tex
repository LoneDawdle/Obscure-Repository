\section{Introduction}

\cite{survey} provides guarantees for the independent case, \cite{roughgarden} shows that POA can be arbitrary bad for general correlation. However correlation is practically important scenario, and even partial positive results can be of value.  

We consider two specific ideas: general per-item correlation and negative correlation. For first we show a counterexample, for second we outline a potential approach for a proof.

We also give an alternative proof of POA for uncorrelated values which we have discovered along the way and find to be more intuitive that the approach taken in \cite{survey}.
