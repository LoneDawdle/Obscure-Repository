\section{Bayes-Nash POA for iid values via weak duality} 
We here provide a proof for the POA of 2 for Bayes-Nash equlibria we constructed in attempts to prove a result for correlated values. Although the approach did not prove to be of use for this purpose, we find it to be more intuitive than the proof of \cite{survey} and of independent interest.
