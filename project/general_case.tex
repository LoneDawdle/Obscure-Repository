\section{General per-item correlation}

The counter-example in \cite{roughgarden} makes a significant use of inter-item correlation, i.e. $cor(v_{ij},v_{ik})\neq 0$. However it can be argued that such type of correlation is not as important in practice as per-item correlation where $v_{ij}$ and $v_{kj}$ are correlated but $cor(v_{ij},v_{ik}) = 0$. Unfortunately, it turns out that this additional assumption does not guarantee a constant factor POA, which we show with the following counter-example.
